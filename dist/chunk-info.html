    A real-time visualisation tool for implicit surfaces, i.e. isolevels
    of real-value functions f(x,y,z). It casts rays through each
    pixel and computes intersections with the surface.
      - left-clicking on the shape with the mouse change the camera position.
      - you can use `predefined shape` or write your custom
        function (glsl, C-like) and press `View Surface`.
      - you can change shape parameters (`a`,`b`,`c`) and use them in your
        functions.
      - you can change the viewed `isolevel` (default is 0).
      - `scale` allows you to zoom in/out of the surface.
      - `center_x`, `center_y`, `center_z` changes the center of view
      - you may decrease `accuracy` to get better details, at the price
        of increased computational burden (check fps above)
      - `singularity` controls how singularity are detected, 1.0: large band
        0.0: invisible.
      - you may change the `color_model` to change the color display of
        surfaces:
        + `RGB`: color is the absolute value of the surface normal vector.
        + `RGB+Grid`: same as above but add shaded lines depending on
          the position (grid).
        + `RGB+Spheres`: same as above but add shaded lines depending on
          the position (spheres).
        + `Phong`: color is an illmuniation model taking into account
          colors and lights.
        + `Phong+Grid`: same as above but add shaded lines depending on
          the position (grid).
        + `Phong+Spheres`: same as above but add shaded lines depending
          on the position (spheres).
        + `Phong+2-layers`: Phong illimunation but the first surface has
          some transparency (see `opacity`), two surface sheets are displayed
          at most.
      - you may change the colors of the surface (diffuse inside/outside),
        specular, singularities.
      - you may change `lights` colors and directions.
      - `view_shape` changes the volume that encloses the isosurface.
      - `view_radius` changes the sizes of the previous volume.
      - `grid_size`, `grid_thickness` and `grid_attenuation` changes the
        display of overlayed grids/spheres.
      - `rotation_x`, `rotation_y`, `rotation_z` changes the current object
        rotation speed.
      - `stop` stops the rotations.
